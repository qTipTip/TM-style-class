A modern LaTeX document class.

This is essentially a copy of the LaTeX-styles defined in
https://github.com/thib1235/LaTeX
with some personal modifications.

This repository contains a LaTeX document-class file with the intention of having a documentclass
that behaves like the PDF-examples in the above repository without the need of a lot of custom functions
and packages.

## Installation

In order to use this package you need the fonts [`Lato`](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) and [`Source Code Pro`](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)

Currently I am just pulling in the `.cls` file and `images/`-folder into my working directoy, however I am sure you can install it globally. 

The icons used can be found at
