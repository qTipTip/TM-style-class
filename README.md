A modern LaTeX document class.

This is essentially a copy of the LaTeX-styles defined in
https://github.com/thib1235/LaTeX
with some personal modifications.

This repository contains a LaTeX document-class file with the intention of having a documentclass
that behaves like the PDF-examples in the above repository without the need of a lot of custom functions
and packages.
